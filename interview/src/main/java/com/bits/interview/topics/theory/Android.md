# Android

Android is an open source and Linux-based Operating System for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google, and other companies.

Android offers a unified approach to application development for mobile devices which means developers need only develop for Android, and their applications should be able to run on different devices powered by Android.

The first beta version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) was released by Google in 2007 whereas the first commercial version, Android 1.0, was released in September 2008.

Android is basically a Mobile platform that consists of,
>OS
>Middle ware
>Key applications

The OS part is the sandwiching layer between software & hardware. Its a linux kernel product & Some of its main Functions are,
Memory Management
Power Management
Resource Management
Driver Management

Middle ware consist of mainly 2 components,
## 1.Application framework
1000 lines of codes embedded in it which makes the app development
easier. For example : WifiManager.class, LocationManager.class etc
## 2.Libraries
Java library [io.* , net.*, etc,..]
+
Native library [OpenGLES] (Non - java library)

Key applications involves applications working on android that can be developed using,
Kotlin
Java (SDK)
C/C++ (NDK)
Dot net (Mono Android)

Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. Kotlin does not aim to be unique—instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants that target the JVM (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native).

Kotlin was created by jetbrains, which is the same company that creates intelliJ IDE. Java & kotlin works seamlessly in one android project

Kotlin's interoperability with Java means that you don’t have to adopt Kotlin all at once. You can have projects with both Kotlin and Java code. For more information on adding Kotlin to an existing app, see Add Kotlin to an existing app. If you are a part of a larger team, the size of your organisation and codebase may necessitate special focus. For tips and other information, see Adopt Kotlin for large teams.
